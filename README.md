**Explanation and Readme for Implementing CI/CD for NestJS Application with TypeORM, PostgreSQL, and AWS**

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Setup for NestJS

#### Objective:
The goal is to set up an automated CI/CD pipeline for a NestJS application using AWS services, specifically AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, Elastic Beanstalk, Docker, and PostgreSQL.

#### Steps:

1. **Version Control Setup:**
   - Ensure the NestJS application code is hosted on a version control system, such as Git (GitHub).

2. **CI Pipeline:**
   - Configure a CI service (GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins) to monitor the repository for changes.
   - Set up CI/CD on AWS for NestJS projects using GitHub, AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and Elastic Beanstalk.
   - Define build steps in the CI pipeline, including linting, running tests, and compiling the NestJS application.

3. **Containerization:**
   - Utilize Docker to containerize the NestJS application.
   - Write a `Dockerfile` to package the application with its dependencies.

4. **PostgreSQL Database Setup:**
   - Create an AWS RDS PostgreSQL instance or use an existing one.
   - Configure TypeORM in the NestJS application to connect to the PostgreSQL database.

5. **AWS Infrastructure:**
   - Set up an AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to store Docker images.
   - Establish an AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) cluster or AWS Fargate to deploy and run the Dockerized NestJS application.

6. **Deployment Automation:**
   - Automate the deployment process by integrating the CI pipeline with AWS services.
   - Define deployment scripts or use tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform for infrastructure as code.

7. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Manage different environment configurations (development, staging, production) using environment variables or AWS Parameter Store/Secrets Manager.

8. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Implement monitoring solutions like AWS CloudWatch for tracking application logs, metrics, and performance.

9. **Security:**
   - Ensure security measures such as IAM roles and permissions, encryption in transit and at rest, and secure database access.

10. **Documentation:**
    - Document the CI/CD process, configuration steps, and any necessary setup for future reference.

#### Expected Outcome:
A fully automated CI/CD pipeline that seamlessly builds, tests, and deploys the NestJS application using TypeORM, PostgreSQL, and AWS services, ensuring scalability, reliability, and efficient development workflows.

### Additional Task: Implementing GET and POST APIs

#### 1. GET API:
   - Create a GET endpoint using NestJS to retrieve data from the PostgreSQL database.
   - Define appropriate routes and controllers to handle the GET request.
   - Utilize TypeORM to query the PostgreSQL database and retrieve relevant data.

#### 2. POST API:
   - Implement a POST endpoint that allows the insertion of data into the PostgreSQL database.
   - Design routes and controllers to handle incoming POST requests.
   - Validate and process incoming data, then use TypeORM to store it in the PostgreSQL database.

#### Expected Outcome:
Two APIs integrated into the NestJS application: one for retrieving data (GET) and another for adding data (POST).
- The GET endpoint should fetch data from the PostgreSQL database and return it in response to client requests.
- The POST endpoint should accept data from clients, process and validate it, and then persist it in the PostgreSQL database.

### How to Run:
1. Clone the Git repository.
2. Configure AWS services and set up environment variables.
3. Set up PostgreSQL database and update TypeORM configuration.
4. Run CI/CD pipeline for automatic deployment.
5. Access the NestJS application's GET and POST APIs.

### Note:
- Ensure AWS credentials and permissions are set up correctly for CI/CD.
- Refer to the documentation for detailed instructions on configuring, deploying, and managing the application.

This README provides an overview of the CI/CD setup and additional tasks, guiding users on the necessary steps to run the NestJS application seamlessly.
